# Moon Landing Simulator

## Inspiration

This project is built for the UofM .devClub Hackathon if 2023. It was inspired by a past computer science assignment I have completed called [Lunar Lander](https://github.com/simarubhi/LunarLander). The assignment was based of the [Lunar Lander game](http://moonlander.seb.ly/). My goal of this project was to expand on the game and add visual and graphical elements to it, creating a website instead of a Java console app.
